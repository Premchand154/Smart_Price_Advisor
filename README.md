Problem Statement

Buyers and sellers often struggle to determine a **fair price** for second-hand products. This app helps:

- **Sellers**: Quote a fair price based on real market indicators
- **Buyers**: Know whether they can **negotiate** or not
- **Both parties**: Understand **why** a certain price was predicted

Features:
.Predicts fair price using a trained **XGBoost** model  
.Suggests whether the price is **negotiable or fixed**  
.Shows **SHAP-based feature contributions** for transparency  
.Built with an interactive **Streamlit** interface
